Vencord Comfy theme by Nyria (https://github.com/Comfy-Themes/Discord.git) with a few fixes and snippets from the official Comfy Discord server. 

I am currently fixing a lot of changes Discord made in the past.
If you find any inconsistencies or unfixed bugs, please report these by opening an issue.
Currently I will add most of the fixes in comfy.css. After being satisfied with my fixes, will I append the fixes to main.css
